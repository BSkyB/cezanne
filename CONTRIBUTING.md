# Contributing to Cezanne

## Can I contribute?
**Yes**.

it would be great to work together and further the development of Cezanne.

Any form of contribution is likely to require some time from the maintainers: please be patient, they'll do their best to fix bugs, discuss features and review PRs in a timely manner.

## How can I contribute?

### Report a bug

If you find a bug in Cezanne, please report it by opening a GitHub issue with the `bug` label, including:

- a good descriptive title
- step by step details on how to reproduce the bug, with code snippets or link to your code / Gist
- describe the behaviour you expected (and why), and the one you got instead
- add as much context and details as possible (eg. is the issue recent? is it reliably reproducible? etc.)

### Suggest a feature

If you think we should improve a feature, or add a brand new one to Cezanne, do so by opening a GitHub issue with the `enhancement` or `feature` label.

### Write some code

If you want to contribute with code, you are very welcome. To keep things tidy, please:

1. fork the repository
2. create a feature branch
3. add your code contribution (including the relevant tests inside the `/spec` folder)
4. open a pull request

If you don't know where to start, take a look at the open issues or feel free to send us a message (contact details are in the [README](README.md))

#### (Brief) Styleguides

- get familiar with the rest of the code, and adhere to the conventions (eg. 2 spaces indentation)
- keep the PRs small and focussed
- keep the commits meaningful and sensible
- use present tense, imperative mood commit titles (eg. `'Add ...'`, `'Set ...'`)
- don't be afraid of being very verbose in the commit messages
- reference relevant issues, PRs etc.
